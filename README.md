# DTAE based on scikit-learn
This is a python implementation of the DTAE algorithm [1] based on scikit-learn. 
This version is faster than the C# implementation at https://github.com/miguelmedinaperez/DTAE.
When working with missing data, this implementation performs data imputation. In this case, the output rules must be read with care.
